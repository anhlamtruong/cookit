- `email`: The user's email address, which must be unique.
- `password`: The user's hashed password for authentication.
- `name`: The user's name, which is optional.
- `roles`: The roles assigned to the user for access control.
- `profile`: A one-to-one relation to the user's profile.
- `status`: The user's account status (active, suspended, etc.).
- `createdAt`: Timestamp of when the user was created.
- `updatedAt`: Timestamp of the last time the user's information was updated.

## Scalability Considerations

To ensure the scalability of the user management system, the following strategies are recommended:

- **Database Indexing**: Ensure that all fields used in queries are properly indexed to speed up read operations.
- **Caching**: Implement caching for frequently accessed data to reduce database load.
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Design the application to run on multiple servers to distribute the load.
- **Microservices**: Consider breaking down the application into microservices to isolate and scale parts of the system independently.
- **Read Replicas**: Use read replicas to distribute the read load across multiple database instances.
- **Sharding**: If the dataset grows very large, consider sharding the database to distribute the write load.
